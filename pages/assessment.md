## Assessment  

Software Carpentry values a culture of assessment, and we are consistently evaluating our workshops to understand the impact workshops have on our learners.

## Surveys  
We conduct pre and post workshop surveys for each of our workshops:

- [Pre-workshop survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Preview/?sm=V6gQbbOKn3NoPKfYKHjAKu_2BBCdtXXsTS2pf1BIdARccEtJQqlu1KFB2j2TcF0MCn)

- [Post-workshop survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Preview/?sm=uN5QPa4MbF1_2BB1plbLWnL1ZUc7Nttqici0Nc0e3G4RahMwwGW5NUp4U5PKQDYmky)

Additionally, we began collecting data on the long-term impact our workshops are having on both Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry learners. The [Carpentry Long-Term Feedback Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Preview/?sm=LksuekfCD3hzLW6lPkx9qhkRF5nDt8uGWpN7lq2Mx0Dqw1Zriv3qYFpu3XtR46ei) was launched in March 2017, and data will be collected every 6 months.

## Data  
Data sets to go along with assessment reports are provided in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpentries/public-survey-info), along with the version of the surveys that were in use at time of analysis.

## Analyses
