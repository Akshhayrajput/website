What did you learn from running Research Carpentry lesson discussion sessions?

* Greg Wilson
  * Trainees told us the sessions were very useful
    * Partly for content
    * Partly as a way to meet community
  * Organizing things through Etherpad is easy but error-prone
  * Timezones are a pain (and daylight savings time is worse)
* Kate Hertweck
  * The scope of questions asked were challenging: some folks had many very specific points about certain challenge questions or pieces of demo code, while others wanted more general information about teaching. I sometimes felt like I failed to meet both of these needs. 
  * The intermittent demand felt like these sessions weren't an efficient use of my time. I often hosted a session with only one or two people, or tried to host a session only to have scheduling issues with the one attendee who needed a host. 
  * Both of the above points reflect my general feeling that sessions which are a bit larger, with multiple experienced hosts, would be most beneficial to attendees (see Greg's point about meeting community above).
    * +1 to multihost sessions, but need to have moderator to focus the resulting panel discussion?
  * Despite the problems above, some attendees were *very* happy to have one-on-one attention where they felt comfortable asking questions they feared others might find "silly" or too "basic," and it felt really nice to know these new instructors weren't falling through the cracks.
* Neal Davis
  * The two sessions I participated in were well-attended, and asked a lot of questions.  I realized partway through that I had never actually seen someone else teach Git (yes, I'd taught it at every workshop I'd done to that point), so I tempered my advice with a comment along the lines of, "You'll come to own the lesson after you've taught it a couple of times."
* Bill Mills
  * Regular sessions a must (but I think we already figured that out)
  * Students consistently had very low awareness of what actually goes on in a SWC workshop. I had numerous questions from different cohorts along the lines of whether or not people would even have their own laptops, whether they were supposed to ask the challenge problems in class etc. At one python session, someone was surprised to learn we also teach shell and git. All these folks were definitely ready to teach the python lesson, as was the point of the discussion, but many of them were not quite ready to help organize a workshop.
  * Aleksandra's guidelines were A+: https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/issues/72#issuecomment-190284557
  * Found it helpful to frame as a confidence building exercise rather than a test (particularly as exactly zero people that I sat with failed this 'test')
* Naupaka Zimmerman
  * Scheduling needs to be improved so this is all more streamlined. I guess this is the point people are talking about with regular sessions. Regular times, or using something like timetrade.com
  * I completely agree with Bills's point about ppl "had very low awareness of what actually goes on in a SWC workshop". I am a bit surprised people sign up to be instructors if they don't know what it is they are getting into?
  * I felt that the most effective use of my time was more related to big picture (well, bigger-ish) questions like how DC differs from SWC, teaching R with base graphics vs ggplot2, and how closely people generally hew to the lessons as they exisit online
  * Conveying enthusiasm and answering basic questions seemed really useful to the trainees - perhaps there is a way to build in some exposure to a SWC/DC workshop (recorded video?) into the core of the training they get before then come to the discussion stage?
  * I really enjoyed these sessions and I think most (all?) people I talked to did too and found them useful
* Sue McClatchy
  * Dealing with diverse abilities was a common theme in each discussion. People were concerned about how to deal with differing levels of ability. I provided some suggestions, and agree that discussions serve to build instructor confidence more than anything.
  * We walked through each lesson step by step in order to generate questions or discussion topics. I think it was helpful to briefly review each lesson and touch upon any uncertainties.
* Harriet Dashnow
  * I agree with most of what had already been said. Just to add that I really enjoyed these sessions. Many of the new instructors I spoke to had substantial teaching experience and so many of the questions were around what makes SWC and DC different and also about how flexible the syllabus is to the needs of their students.
