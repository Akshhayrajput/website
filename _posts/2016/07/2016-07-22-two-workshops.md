Brisbane and Toowoomba are 125 km apart in Queensland. Software Carpentry workshops were held in both cities 
a week apart (11-12 July and 18-19 July). I taught at both.

The Brisbane workshop was held at [The University of Queensland](http://www.uq.edu.au/) while the [University of 
Southern Queensland](http://www.usq.edu.au/) hosted the Toowoomba one - their first ever Software Carpentry 
workshop. They have already requested a subsequent workshop on R.

Newly minted instructor [Francis Gacenga](https://twitter.com/fgacenga) taught part of Git for the first time, 
while [Leah Roberts](https://twitter.com/Loolibear) taught Python for the first time, having taught her first 
session of Git at the Brisbane workshop a week before. 

Apart from Leah, the instructors for the Brisbane workshop were a mixture of old hands - [Areej Al-Sheikh]
(https://twitter.com/areejalsheikh), [Paula Martinez](https://twitter.com/orchid00), and me, with one newbie, 
[Joshua Thia](https://twitter.com/joshua_thia), who certified as an instructor this week, having trained in the 
same January cohort as Leah and Francis under the expert eye of [Aleksandra Pawlik](https://twitter.com/aleksandrana).

At both workshops, We used a mixture of cloud - the [D1T4C](https://dit4c.github.io/) setup - and local laptops
which caused a bit of confusion, especially in getting the data to the right place for the shell and Python exercises in Toowoomba.

The D1T4C cloud option does simplify matters for people who have struggled to get the software installed, or who 
find they can't cut and paste easily from their Windows command line. But it is always difficult to cater for the 
different systems, so next time, we will print out the different data set up instructions for Mac, Windows and 
cloud and have those on tap. (Linux is never a problem.)  

Our other gotcha is the eduroam wireless we use for workshops. My wireless connection dropped out just as I tried 
to do a 'git push' at the Brisbane workshop, and the only way I could reconnect was to reboot the machine. 

I was wiser in Toowoomba, rebooting my laptop just before I had to teach the second part of Git. `Git push` still 
took three goes as the repository I was pushing to had not granted me permission in time. 

But I succeeded in the end. 

Toowoomba was the fifth city in Queensland where Software Carpentry has been taught since our first workshop here
in 2014. We hope to clock up a sixth town with a workshop at 
the [University of the Sunshine Coast](http://www.usc.edu.au) later this year.
