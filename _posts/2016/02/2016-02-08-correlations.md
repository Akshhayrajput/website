We've run instructor training both online and in person for several years,
so it's time to look at how they compare.
The [raw data]({{site.filesurl}}/2016/02/instructor-training-stats.csv) shows:

* the event's start date
* its unique identifier (which we call a "slug")
* whether it was online
* how many people took part
* how many completed training after this course (both as an absolute number and as a percentage)
* how many completed after taking a later course (in both forms)
* how many have never completed
* how many have taught at least once since taking the course

The plot below then shows completion rates and follow-through teaching rates (as percentages) versus cohort size,
tagged by whether the training event was online or in person,
for all events that took place at least one year ago.
(I've used that cutoff to give participants a fair chance to teach after completing their training.)

There are lots of other ways to analyze this data---if you can find any interesting correlations,
please post as comments below.
