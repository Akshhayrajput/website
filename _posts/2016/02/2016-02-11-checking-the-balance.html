  It's been a depressing couple of weeks.
  On top of yet more reports of universities turning a blind eye to sexual harassment for years,
  a <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/1733/">new paper</a> of gender bias in open source
  shows that,
  "...women's contributions tend to be accepted more often than men's.
  However, when a woman's gender is identifiable, they are rejected more often."
  This comes on top of earlier studies
  (like <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~bvasiles/papers/socinfo12.pdf">this one</a>)
  showing that women are substantially less well represented in open online forums like Stack Overflow
  than in computing as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  This prompted me to take another look at how Software Carpentry is doing.
  To start,
  here are the number of people contributing to our core lesson repositories
  in January 2016,
  by gender.
  (I'd like to show number for a whole year,
  but <a href="{{site.filesurl}}/2016/02/balance/bin/get-repo.py">my script</a>
  won't fetch stuff from that far back.)
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Repository Contributors by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>19</td><td>79</td><td>-</td><td>14</td></tr>
  <tr><th>%age</th><td>17.0%</td><td>70.5%</td><td>-</td><td>12.5%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  17% female is better than average for GitHub and Stack Overflow,
  but still pretty poor.
  The proportion is even worse when we count number of contributions
  rather than number of contributors:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Repository Contributions by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>69</td><td>532</td><td>-</td><td>28</td></tr>
  <tr><th>%age</th><td>11.0%</td><td>84.6%</td><td>-</td><td>4.5%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  This allows us to calculate contributions per person:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Repository Contributions per Person by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>3.6</td><td>6.7</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  But now let's compare this to the stats for Software Carpentry's core mission:
  delivering workshops.
  Our next table shows the number of people who taught workshops in 2015:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Workshop Instructors by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>89</td><td>193</td><td>121</td><td>3</td></tr>
  <tr><th>%age</th><td>21.9%</td><td>47.5%</td><td>29.8%</td><td>0.7%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  while this one shows the actual number of workshops taught
  (e.g., if I taught three times, I count as three points in the male column):
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Workshops Taught by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>182</td><td>406</td><td>163</td><td>4</td></tr>
  <tr><th>%age</th><td>24.1%</td><td>53.8%</td><td>21.6%</td><td>0.5%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  and this one shows the average number of workshops taught by each instructor:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Repository Contributions per Person by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>2.0</td><td>2.1</td><td>1.3</td><td>1.3</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  There are several ways to look at this data:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Some people are worried that our pipeline is leaky,
    i.e.,
    that only about half of the people who complete instructor training
    go on to teach for us within a year of doing so.
    I care a lot less about that than I do about our gender balance.
  </li>
</ol>
