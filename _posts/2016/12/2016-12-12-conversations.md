Software and Data Carpentry have at their core a collaboration-driven ethos, and communication is key to that collaboration. 
We’re reaffirming our commitment to open and transparent communication, because we know we can do better! We want to give community 
members opportunities to talk to each other, staff and Steering Committees, to get updates on efforts and activities and to generate ideas 
and participate in discussions.  

So, first, we want to hear from you!  

What ideas do you have about communication? What do you want to hear from us? What channels do you like to use for communication? 
Do you like email lists or forums that include every topic, or ones on particular questions, domains or regions? What do you like about 
communication now? What don’t you like?  

We’re going to be working on communication channels and strategies to promote and support these ideas, and continue to make the 
Carpentries a community that you are excited to be a part of, so please let us know what you think!  

Please respond as a comment to this post, or in our 
["conversations" repository on GitHub](https://github.com/carpentries/conversations/issues/1)
(we're considering these our suggestion boxes) if you have particular topics. Thanks for your feedback!
