The [Data Carpentry]({{site.dc_url}}) and [Software Carpentry]({{site.url}}) Steering Committees
recently approved [a process for supporting [the incubation of new lessons]({{site.baseurl}}/lessons/incubation).
If you would like to build something substantial for either of the Carpentries,
we'd enjoy hearing from you.
