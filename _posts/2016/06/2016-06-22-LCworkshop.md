I ran a two-day 'Library Carpentry' workshop for librarians at The University of Queensland on 13-14 June. The class covered

- jargon-busting and data structures
- regular expressions
- command line tools to find data in files
- version control
- [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) for data cleanup

Eighteen people attended from a pool of 26 who expressed interest. (I only had room for 18.)
