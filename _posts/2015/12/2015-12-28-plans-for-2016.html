<p>
  Twelve months is a long time.
  A year ago
  I was wrapping up my second month without an income
  and had serious doubts about whether Software Carpentry was going to be viable.
  Today,
  our new <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/10/more-about-jonah-duckles.html">Executive Director</a>
  is in place,
  our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/11/introducing_maneesha.html">Program Coordinator</a>
  has our workshops running more smoothly than ever,
  our <a href="{{site.github_url}}/amy/">workshop administration tool</a> is ticking over nicely,
  we're about to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/12/call-for-candidates-elections-2016.html">elect our second Steering Committee</a>,
  we've <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/12/call-for-candidates-elections-2016.html">published our lessons</a>,
  we have <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/scf/partners/">18 partners and affiliates</a>,
  our <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/09/rebooting-instructor-training.html">reboot of instructor training</a>
  has 
  and our sibling organization, Data Carpentry,
  has <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/moore/">received a major grant</a>
  that will keep it running for at least three years.
