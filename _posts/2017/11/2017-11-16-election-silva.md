## Who am I?

My name is Raniere Silva.
I'm Brazilian but live in Manchester, UK
where I work for the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) as Community Officer.
The Institute has a [Fellowship Programme](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme)
that supports activities related with good software practice,
including Carpentry workshops or inspired by this incredible community.
Said that, my job, to some extension, is facilitate the Carpentry activities in the UK.

## Previous Involvement

I discovered Software Carpentry in 2013 when reading [this blog post](https://kaythaney.com/2013/06/14/announcing-the-mozilla-science-lab/)
after being redirect by [this announcement](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/06/14/5992/).
Months later,
I was [joining](http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2013/08/raniere-silva/) the 6th round of instructor training
along side Leszek Tarkowski, Michael Crusoe, Christina Koch, Mark Laufersweiler, Jonah Duckles and many other fabulous instructors
that I would only meet in person years later.

In 2014,
Fernando Mayer and I taught the first Software Carpentry workshop in Brazil and South America.
At the same year,
I had the opportunity to taught more Software Carpentry workshops in Brazil
with some international visitors: Alex Viana and Diego Barneche.

[2015](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/01/scf-nomination-silva.html)
and
[2016](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/01/steering-raniere-silva.html)
were the time to stand up and serve at Software Carpentry Steering Committee.
During that time,
I got specially involved with the mentoring activities,
now being lead by Marian Schmidt and Jamie Hadwin,
and pushed, in some form, the culture to have more than one session to help
volunteers to attend those independent of where they live and their personal commitments.

At the end of 2016,
I decided that was time to let others contribute to the project as members of the Steering Committee.
Kate Hertweck contacted me asking to help with the [lesson styles](https://github.com/swcarpentry/styles)
and most of my contributions to the project this year has been in the technical side.

Last week,
a friend delivered a Carpentry-inspired [workshop](https://github.com/SantosRAC/Python4BioDataBrazilianWorkshop) in Brazil
with a very positive feedback from the learners
and with requests for more similar events.
I was part of the Steering Committee of that workshop 
and it motivated me to apply to serve on the Steering Committee another time.

## Strengths

In the five years that I'm involved with the Carpentries,
the top 3 strengths that I see in the project are

- Carpentries name/brand,
  which is recognised in many places,
- transparency,
  which is **very** hard to do but is always on our priority list,
  and
- community,
  that is passionate about the project
  and
  share their lesson learnt when teaching
  to leverage fellow instructors
  (for this week examples,
  see [this email](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss/2017-November/005585.html) and [this pull request](https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/pull/438)).

## Weaknesses

But I also see the current weaknesses in project
that we should be careful in the short (2 years) future.
The top 3 items on my list are

- procedures,
  which need to be documented in a public/shared place
  as they are extremely important for the on-boarding process
  of new members of staff or volunteers
  but register this knowledge is takes time
  and in some cases put lower on our list,
- communication,
  with the recent increase on numbers of our staff and volunteer
  we need to share the information with more people
  and still keep the number of emails, chat messages, meetings lower,
  which is almost contradictory,
  and we are doing a very poor job (**no one to blame here**),
- diversity,
  we are very proud to be a inclusive community
  but, as [Greg Wilson mentioned here](http://third-bit.com/2017/11/05/for-everyone.html),
  we need to review our definitions
  and work to improve our numbers.

## Two Years From Now

My metrics of success for the Carpentry in two years time are:

- 5 team of staff with at least two members based in UTC-8, UTC-5/UTC-3, UTC+1, UTC+8 and UTC+12 to secure the support to our worldwide community.
- 30% of partners from United States and Canada, 30% from Europe, 30% from [Oceania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania), [East Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia) and [Southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia) and 10% of other places. I would love to see more partners from South America, Africa and Asia but I know is unrealistic at the moment.
- Clarification of the ways that volunteers could engage with the community. Although teaching workshops will continue to be the primary way to contribute followed by lesson development, volunteers can contribute in other forms but they need a clear path to help us.
- Two studies, one in 2018 and another in 2019, about our retention rate of instructors and other volunteers without duplicating the work being done by the [Community Health Analytics Open Source Software (CHAOSS) project](https://chaoss.community/).
- Two in-person get together meeting, one is 2018 and another in 2019, for the community. This one is [almost half done](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/11/carpentrycon.html)!

## Conclusion

Thanks very much for your consideration to have me again as member of the Steering Committee.
If I'm elected, I will put community, diversity and sustainability as first on our decision as a group.
