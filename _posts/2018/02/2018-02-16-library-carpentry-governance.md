Eight of us from Australia, the UK, the US, Canada and South Africa met this week via zoom to discuss taking 
the [Library Carpentry](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry) project forward.

We discussed the creation of a new website to replace [this one](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/), talked about 
what constitutes a Library Carpentry workshop, discussed who can teach the material, and what kind of governance structure 
we need to take the work forward. There was an update on the status of the [IMLS-funded Library Carpentry Coordinator role to be based at CDL](http://www.datacarpentry.org/jobs/).

### The website

[Richard Vankoningsveld](https://twitter.com/richyvk) has done a great draft of 
a [new website](https://www.richyvk.me/library-carpentry-redesign/). 
Can people please have a look at it and raise issues that need fixing on the repo itself? 
We will move it across once we have the material up to date. If you are interested in working on the 
repo or having rights to edit, ask there by raising an issue.

### What is a workshop?

We need to make a decision about what the 'core' curriculum is for a workshop to be badged Library Carpentry. 
We have a statement to that effect on the old website. See [What is a workshop?](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/about/) 
We will revisit that in the coming weeks. Belinda suggested that the core curriculum could be 
[Intro to Data](http://data-lessons.github.io/library-data-intro/) (which includes regular expressions), [Shell](http://data-lessons.github.io/library-shell/) and [OpenRefine](http://data-lessons.github.io/library-openrefine/). That can be taught within a (fairly intense) 
day. People can then add extras from the [other modules under development](https://github.com/data-lessons) if they want to have 
a two-day format, or 
they can stretch the core curriculum to be taught over two days, which would give more time for people to practise 
and embed what they have learned.

### One day or two days?

Librarians often struggle to be granted two consecutive days off for training, which is why the 
one-day format might be the way we go forward for now. If we want to have a two-day format, 
then the workshop could be split over four mornings, or we could teach single days in separate weeks.

### Who is an instructor?

The question of [Who is an instructor?](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/about) has been addressed 
on the old website. Please add your thoughts. If we are to merge with the Carpentries, we need to move to a 
model where instructors have completed the [Carpentries instructor training program](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/). However, we do not want to mandate that certification for now as we do not have enough trained instructors. Belinda will ask the Carpentries to schedule two open trainings specifically for librarians this year.

Though this was not raised at the meeting, we should consider developing an onboarding process for 
certified Data and Software Carpentry instructors who would like to teach Library Carpentry.

### Governance

Belinda suggested that at the minimum we need a chair, a co-chair and a secretary, and suggested 
she could be the liaison between the governance group and the Carpentries. Tim Dennis and Juliane Schneidler 
have put together [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U0F4HCW7YcZx319_KL4d0i473C4sDx5P7jnwqejer9w/edit)
for discussion about the role of a governance group.

Greg Wilson proposed we review that document between now and May, with a view to electing an interim governance group
when we meet at [CarpentryCon 2018](http://www.carpentrycon.org/) in Dublin. Please add your thoughts.

### Workshop requests

The Carpentries are now taking responsibility for organising Library Carpentry workshops. 
[Use this form](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/request/) to request a Library Carpentry workshop.

### Library Carpentry Position based at CDL

Interviews are ongoing for [this position](http://www.datacarpentry.org/jobs/). It was readvertised when no 
appointment was made from the first round. We hope that there will be an appointment soon. The person in 
the role will work jointly with CDL and the Carpentries, and will look at finalising lessons, and buiding a 
network to grow workshop and instructor numbers in the US and more globally.

All in all, this was a very productive meeting. This group plans to meet monthly to discuss business as we move forward 
to a merger with the Carpentries.

Post-Dublin, we should have a governance group that, with the help of the CDL-based position, can take forward the work 
of finalising lessons, defining core curriculum, extending workshops, and boosting instructor numbers. Having that group 
will also put us in a position to seek additional funding from library associations and related groups who might be 
interested in supporting our work.

It is an exciting time to be involved with Library Carpentry! [Come and say hi in 
the chatroom](https://gitter.im/LibraryCarpentry/Lobby) and start your Library 
Carpentry journey. You can watch [our Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/LibCarpentry) for news too.
