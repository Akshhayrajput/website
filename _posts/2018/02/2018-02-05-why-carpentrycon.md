Getting a PhD is, was or will be a major career milestone for many in our community. 

Yet getting a PhD, momentous as that achievement is, is really just the first step on the career ladder.
Employers increasingly want other skills as well.

In all kinds of surveys, the same key skills keep popping up:

Communication skills. Teamwork. Problem solving. Ethical and intercultural understanding. Leadership. Critical thinking.

The wording may be slightly different but what it boils down to is this: employers want people who can lead, and they want people 
who can collaborate.

Yet few academic conferences focus on building those kinds of skills, focusing instead on advances within a discipline. 
Conference attendance may help people develop skills in, say, speaking and presenting, but that is generally a by-product.

CarpentryCon will be different. Its main aim is to help people develop the professional skills to drive their careers forward. 

We want to teach the next generation of research leaders not just technical skills – though these are becoming increasingly 
important – but skills such as promoting diversity and inclusion, project and lab leadership, 
and speaking well, as our [program]( http://www.carpentrycon.org/#prog) demonstrates.

Many universities claim to turn out graduates with a desirable set of attributes, yet few offer 
concrete opportunities for students to acquire those skills. 

CarpentryCon will.

Find out if *your* university is really serious about equipping you for your future career. 

Ask them to send you to CarpentryCon.

[Registrations are open now](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/carpentrycon-2018-tickets-42447719271). 

For those whose pleas fall on unsympathetic ears, we hope to be able to offer *some* level of travel subsidy. However, we have not yet finalised the budget for that. If you buy a ticket and then find you are unable to afford to come, you can get a refund. If you buy a ticket, you can also still apply for travel assistance. More on all this once we finalise our arrangements.
