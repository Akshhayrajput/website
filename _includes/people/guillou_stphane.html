<span class="person">Stéphane Guillou</span> is a research assistant (The University of Queensland) generally looking into sustainable agriculture. He is also a Free Software enthusiast and a "universal access to knowledge" idealist. You can find him tinkering with Linux-based systems, playing with digital sounds, looking at plants and cycling around Brisbane. He also runs a community radio show and spends a healthy amount of time being a proud parent. Stéphane is more than happy to be contributing to the Carpentries as the organisation offers a very useful and somewhat ethical toolbox to researchers <96> or anyone interested in learning new handy computing skills. </p>
